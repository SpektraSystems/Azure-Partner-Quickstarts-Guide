<p>When you need to pass a secure value (like a  password) as a parameter during deployment, you can retrieve the value from  an&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-whatis" Target="blank">Azure Key Vault</a>. You retrieve the value  by referencing the key vault and secret in your parameter file. The value is  never exposed because you only reference its key vault ID. You do not need to  manually enter the value for the secret each time you deploy the resources. The  key vault can exist in a different subscription than the resource group you are  deploying to. When referencing the key vault, you include the subscription ID. <br>
  <br>You should plan to use Key Vault to enhance  the security of overall solutions. This could be pretty useful in scenarios of  complex Quickstarts passing credentials or other secrets between resources.
