<p>For a given resource, there can be other resources that  must exist before the resource is deployed. For example, a SQL server must  exist before attempting to deploy a SQL database. You define this relationship  by marking one resource as dependent on the other resource. You define a  dependency with the dependsOn element, or by using the reference function. </p>
<p>Resource Manager evaluates the dependencies between  resources, and deploys them in their dependent order. When resources are not  dependent on each other, Resource Manager deploys them in parallel. You only  need to define dependencies for resources that are deployed in the same  template.</p>
<br><p><strong>DependsOn</strong></p>
<p>Within your template, the dependsOn element enables you  to define one resource as a dependent on one or more resources. Its value can  be a comma-separated list of resource names.</p>
<p>When defining dependencies, you can include the resource  provider namespace and resource type to avoid ambiguity. For example, to  clarify a load balancer and virtual network that may have the same names as  other resources, use the following format:<br>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;dependsOn&quot;: [ <br>
      &nbsp; &quot;[concat('Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/',      variables('loadBalancerName'))]&quot;, <br>
      &nbsp;      &quot;[concat('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/',      variables('virtualNetworkName'))]&quot; <br>
      ] </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
</p>
<p>While you may be inclined to use dependsOn to map  relationships between your resources, it's important to understand why you're  doing it. For example, to document how resources are interconnected, dependsOn  is not the right approach. You cannot query which resources were defined in the  dependsOn element after deployment. By using dependsOn, you potentially impact  deployment time because Resource Manager does not deploy in parallel two  resources that have a dependency. To document relationships between resources,  instead use resource linking.
</p>
<br><p><strong>Dependencies  Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Set as few dependencies as possible.</li>
  <li>Set a child resource as dependent on its  parent resource.</li>
  <li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>reference&nbsp;</strong>function to set implicit dependencies between  resources that need to share a property. Do not add an explicit dependency (<strong>dependsOn</strong>) when you have already  defined an implicit dependency. This approach reduces the risk of having  unnecessary dependencies.</li>
  <li>Set a dependency when a resource cannot  be&nbsp;created&nbsp;without functionality from another resource. Do not set a  dependency if the resources only interact after deployment.</li>
  <li>Let dependencies cascade without setting them  explicitly. For example, your virtual machine depends on a virtual network  interface, and the virtual network interface depends on a virtual network and  public IP addresses. Therefore, the virtual machine is deployed after all three  resources, but do not explicitly set the virtual machine as dependent on all  three resources. This approach clarifies the dependency order and makes it  easier to change the template later.</li>
  <li>If a value can be determined before  deployment, try deploying the resource without a dependency. For example, if a  configuration value needs the name of another resource, you might not need a  dependency. This guidance does not always work because some resources verify  the existence of the other resource. If you receive an error, add a dependency.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Resource Manager identifies circular dependencies during  template validation. If you receive an error stating that a circular dependency  exists, evaluate your template to see if any dependencies are not needed and  can be removed. If removing dependencies does not work, you can avoid circular  dependencies by moving some deployment operations into child resources that are  deployed after the resources that have the circular dependency</p>
