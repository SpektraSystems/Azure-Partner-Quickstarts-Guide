<br>
<p>If you&rsquo;re building a template which needs  some existing resources in subscription to complete the deployment, it is  recommended to create a pre-requisite azure deployment template.<br />
  Some of the examples of existing resources  includes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Virtual Network </li>
  <li>Storage Account</li>
  <li>Key vault</li>
</ul>
<br><p>Some users may or may not have these existing  resources ready, which may lead to a deployment failure of the solution  template. To avoid this, it is recommended to create a azureprereqdeploy.json  ARM template which can be deployed before the actual Quickstart to avoid  deployment failure of main Quickstart solution due to existing resources.  Partner should also add this is documentation.<br />
  Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
  <li>Identify Number and type of pre-req components  for the Quickstart</li>
  <li>Create ARM template to create the existing  resources</li>
  <li>Output the name&rsquo;s etc. values in the pre-req  template deployment</li>
  <li>Update the documentation/process to share  these details to the users who doesn&rsquo;t have existing resources created already.</li>
</ul>
