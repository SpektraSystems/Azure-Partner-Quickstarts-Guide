<h4><b>B. Template Variables Checklis</b></h4> 
<ul>
<li>Use variables for values that you need to use more than once in a template. If a value is used only once, a hard-coded value makes your template easier to read.</li>
<li> You cannot use the reference function in the variables section. The reference function derives its value from the resource's runtime state, but variables are resolved during the initial parsing of the template. Instead, construct values that need the reference function directly in the resources or outputs section of the template.  </li>
<li>Name variables using this scheme templateScenarioResourceName (e.g. simpleLinuxVMVNET, userRoutesNSG, elasticsearchPublicIP etc.) that describe the scenario rather. This ensures when a user browses all the resources in the Portal there aren't a bunch of resources with the same name (e.g. myVNET, myPublicIP, myNSG)  </li>
<li>Include variables for resource names that need to be unique, as shown in Resource names.</li>
<li>You can group variables into complex objects. You can reference a value from a complex object in the format variable.subentry. Grouping variables helps you track related variables and improves readability of the template.
