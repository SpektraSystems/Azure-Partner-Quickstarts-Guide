<h4><b>M.	Using Market place items in templates</b></h4>
<p>You should identify all the marketplace items used in the  Quickstart and their licensing consideration. Using marketplace products have  following consideration.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You should always use marketplace image of  any 3rd party product used in the Quickstart solution wherever available,  instead of installing it manually using custom script extension. This  simplifies the licenses and pricing of third party products.</li>
  <li>Marketplace items requires programmatic  deployment of marketplace item to be enabled in the subscription. You can do  this by deploying the marketplace item in subscription manually via portal  once.</li>
  <li>Marketplace items will require a payment  method associated with subscriptions.</li>
  <li>Ensure that Template Documentation describe  all marketplace items used in the quickstart.</li>
  <li>You must include unique GUID as tag in all template where marketplace product is used. Reach out to <a href="mailto:quickstartssupport@spektrasystems.com">quickstartssupport@spektrasystems.com</a> if you don't have GUID available for marketplace product being used in solutions.</li>
</ul>
