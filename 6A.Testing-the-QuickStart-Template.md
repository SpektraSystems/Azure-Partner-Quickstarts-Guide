<p>After developing the solution, you  should ensure to test it by deploying in various scenarios such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Test template deployment in maximum type  subscriptions such as Pay as you go, MSDN, CSP(Cloud Solution Provider),  EA(Enterprise Agreement) if possible. This will help in identifying if any type  or resources are not available in any of subscription type.For Example, a  template involving deployment of Windows 10 Virtual Machines may not work with  CSP/EA Subscription as it requires MSDN Subscription. Include findings&nbsp; in README document, if any.</li>
<br><li>Test  the template deployment using
  <ul>
    <li>azuredeploy.json based testing via Azure  Portal &gt;&gt; New Template Deployment wizard</li>
    <li>Testing with azuredeploy.json and  azuredeploy.parameters.json via Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI.</li>
    <li>Visual Studio(If being used)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<br><li>Ensure the azure portal displays deployment succeed status.
<li>Test  the deployment to understand if deployment is exceeding the default  subscription limits(Max number of CPU core etc.) with default parameter values.  If yes, include this in README.file pre-requisite section. 
<li>Capture  the deployment results and examine time taken by the template to finish
<li>Examine  the dependencies based upon deployment results.
<li>Perform  all post-configuration tasks to verify entire solution end to end flow.
</ul>
