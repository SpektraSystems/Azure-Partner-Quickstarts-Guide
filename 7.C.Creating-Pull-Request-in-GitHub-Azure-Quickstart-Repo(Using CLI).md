<p>Now, you are ready for creating pull request in GitHub  for submitting the template. You should have a github account to perform this,  if you don&rsquo;t have an existing account, you can get one <a href="https://github.com/join">here</a> </p>
<br><p>You need to follow these steps to submit a PR.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access  Azure GitHub Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates" Target="blank">https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates</a> </li>
  <li>If you  don't have Git installed, head over to the official&nbsp;<a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">Git Download page and download it</a>. Once downloaded and installed,  you might also want to install&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git">Posh Git</a>. If you're already using Chocolatey or Windows  10's package manager to install software, you can simply run the following  command from an elevated PowerShell (right click, select 'Run as  Administrator'):</li>
</ul>
<p>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>cinst git.install<br>
      cinst poshgit</p>
    <p># Restart PowerShell / CMDer before moving on - or run<br>
      $env:Path =      [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;Path&quot;,&quot;Machine&quot;)      + &quot;;&quot; +      [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;Path&quot;,&quot;User&quot;)</p>
    <p>cinst git-credential-winstore<br>
      cinst github</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Git has  multiple ways of pushing - and changed the default behaviour a few years ago.&nbsp;<em>git config --global push.default</em><em>&nbsp;</em>configures  what branches will be pushed to the remote. The default in Git 2.0 is&nbsp;simple&nbsp;meaning that whenever&nbsp;git push&nbsp;is run, only the current branch is  pushed. Prior to version 2.0, the default behaviour was&nbsp;matching,  meaning that a&nbsp;git  push&nbsp;would push all  branches with a matching branch on the remote.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git config --global push.default simple</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
</p>
<br><ul>
  <li>Fork the  repository to your account : Open <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates" Target="blank">Azure/azure-Quickstart-templates</a> repository and click  the little 'fork' button in the upper right.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="Images/Images/6.jpg"  height="300" width="600"/><br/> </p>
<ul>
  <li>This will  create a copy of the repository as it exists in the&nbsp;azure&nbsp;organization (hence called  azure/azure-quick-start-templates) in your own account.</li>
  <li>Visit your  fork (which should be at github.com/{your_name}/azure-quick-start-templates)  and copy the &quot;HTTPS Clone URL&quot;. Using this URL, you're able to&nbsp;clone&nbsp;the repository, which is really just a  fancy way of saying &quot;download the whole repository, including its history  and information about its origin&quot;.</li>
  <li>Now that  you have Git installed, open up PowerShell. If everything worked correctly, you  should be able to run&nbsp;git  --version. If that works, navigate to a folder where you'd like  to keep the&nbsp;arm-templates&nbsp;repository (and hence, all your arm  templates). To get a copy of your fork onto your local machine, run:</li>
</ul>
<p>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/%7bYOUR_USERNAME%7d/azure-quick-start-templates" Target="blank">https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/azure-quick-start-templates</a> </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can run&nbsp;explorer  arm-templates&nbsp;to  open up the folder. All the files are there - including the history of the  whole repository. The connection to your fork (your_name/arm-templates)  is still there. To confirm that,&nbsp;cd&nbsp;into the cloned folder and run the  following command, which will show you all the remote repositories registered:</li>
</ul>
<p>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git remote -v</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The output should be:</li>
</ul>
<p>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Users\abc\azure-quick-start-templates [master]&gt; git remote      -v<br>
      origin https://github.com/sedouard/arm-templates (fetch)<br>
      origin https://github.com/sedouard/arm-templates (push) </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>As you can see, we're  connected to your fork of the arm-templates (called &quot;origin&quot;), but  currently not connected to the upstream version living in&nbsp;catalystcode/arm-templates.  To change that, we can simply add remotes. Run the following command:
</li>
</ul>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git remote add upstream      https://github.com/azure/azure-quick-start-templates</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Entering&nbsp;git remote  -v&nbsp;again should  give you both repositories - both yours (called &quot;origin&quot;) and the one  for the whole team (called &quot;upstream&quot;).</li>
  <li>Now create a new branch for  your template
</li>
</ul>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git checkout master<br>
      git checkout -b my-new-branch</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>You can now go ahead and make  your changes - adding files, your template, fixing typos. Keep in mind that a  branch should host isolated changes: You would normally not fix someone else's  template and add a new one in branch. Instead, you create one branch that fixes  typos; and another branch for your added template.</li>
  <li>Now that you made your  changes, you can &quot;stage&quot; them for a commit. Whenever you stage a file  for a commit, you make a snapshot of the file at the time you're staging it for  a commit. If you change a file after you staged it, you will have to stage it  again. To stage a file, simply run:
</li>
</ul>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git add ./path-to/my-file.md</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>If you just want to stage all  files in your current repository (including deletions), run:
</li>
</ul>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git add --all .</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Now that your changes have  been staged, we're ready to commit them. You can either pass the commit command  a title for your commit - or omit the parameter, in which case Git will open up  the default text editor to create a commit message.</li>
  <li>To commit the quick way:
</li>
</ul>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git commit -m &quot;Add template: 3 VMS 1 Subnet&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>To commit the long way,  allowing you to define both title and message of your commit:
</li>
</ul>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git commit</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Push your new Branch to Your  Fork on GitHub : You wrote a template, made some changes, committed - now we  have to make sure that your changes also end up on GitHub. To do so, we have to  push your local branch to your fork on GitHub. Run the command below (obviously  using the name of the branch you want to push)
</li>
</ul>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git checkout NAME_OF_YOUR_BRANCH<br>
      git push -u origin      NAME_OF_YOUR_BRANCH</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Now, head over to the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/%7bYOUR_USERNAME%7d/azure-quick-start-templates" Target="blank">https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/azure-quick-start-templates</a> &nbsp;repository. In most  cases, GitHub will pick up on the fact that you just pushed a branch with some  changes to your local fork, assuming that you probably want for those changes  to end up in the upstream branch. To help you, it'll show a little box right  above the code asking you if you want to make a pull request. </li>
</ul>
<img src="Images/Images/5.jpg"  height="100" width="700"/><br/>
<ul>
  <li>Click that button. GitHub will  open up the 'Create a Pull Request Page'. It is probably a good idea to notify  potential reviewers in your pull request. You can do this by doing an @mention  to the maintainer of the repository.</li>
  <li>As soon as you hit the 'Create  Pull Request' button, it'll show up in the list of pull requests and trigger  some automated validation.</li>
  <li>You can find your pull request  on the Github Azure QuickStart repo &gt;&gt; Pull Requests. You should be  following this PR thread until your template gets published</li>
</ul>
