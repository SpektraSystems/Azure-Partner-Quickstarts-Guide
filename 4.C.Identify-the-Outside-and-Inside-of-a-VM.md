<p>As you  design your template, it&rsquo;s helpful to look at the requirements in terms of  what&rsquo;s outside and inside of the virtual machines (VMs): </p>
<ul>
  <li>Outside  means the VMs and other resources of your deployment, such as the network  topology, tagging, references to the certs/secrets, and role-based access control.  All are part of your ARM template. </li>
  <li>For the  VM&rsquo;s insides&mdash;that is, the installed software and overall desired state  configuration&mdash;other mechanisms are used in whole or in part, such as VM  extensions or scripts. These may be identified and executed by the template but  aren&rsquo;t in it.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Common  examples of activities you would do &ldquo;inside the box&rdquo; include </p>
<ul>
  <li>Install or remove server roles and features</li>
  <li>Install and configure software at the node or  cluster level</li>
  <li>Deploy websites on a web server</li>
  <li>Deploy database schemas</li>
  <li>Manage registry or other types of  configuration settings</li>
  <li>Manage files and directories</li>
  <li>Start, stop, and manage processes and  services</li>
  <li>Manage local groups and user accounts</li>
  <li>Install and manage packages (.msi, .exe, yum,  etc.)</li>
  <li>Manage environment variables</li>
  <li>Run native scripts (Windows PowerShell, bash,  etc.)</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Typically,  you will use one or more VM extension to achieve automatic  provisioning of inside VM components. Most widely used VM Extension will  include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Desired State Configuration (DSC)</li>
  <li>Custom Script Extension (For both Windows and  Linux VM&rsquo;s)</li>
  <li>Other 3rd part VM Extension such as  Chef/Puppet etc.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Defining inside and outside VM things will help you in  designing the solution template effectivity.</p></font>
