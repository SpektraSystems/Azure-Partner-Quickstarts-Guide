<h4><b>G.	Updating Pull Requests</b></h4>
<p>Once people have reviewed your pull request, it is very likely  that you want to update it. Whenever you update the branch in your fork, your  pull request will be automatically updated.<br>
  Let's look at a scenario: You just pushed  your branch (using&nbsp;git push -u origin NAME_OF_YOUR_BRANCH), went to GitHub, and created a Pull Request.<br>
  To update the PR with additional changes, edit your files in  your branch - then, commit the changes and push them to GitHub:<br>
<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>git checkout NAME_OF_YOUR_BRANCH<br>
      # Make changes, stage all changes for commit<br>
      git add --all .<br>
      # Commit<br>
      git commit<br>
      # Push to GitHub<br>
      git push git push -u origin NAME_OF_YOUR_BRANCH</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p>If you want to update your Pull Request  without creating a new commit, you can &quot;amend&quot; your last commit. To  do so, call&nbsp;<em>git commit</em><em>&nbsp;</em>with  the&nbsp;<em>--amend</em><em>&nbsp;</em>parameter  and force-push the result to GitHub, overwriting the previous version.</p>
